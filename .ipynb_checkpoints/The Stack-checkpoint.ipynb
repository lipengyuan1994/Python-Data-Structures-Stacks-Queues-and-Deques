    "* Now that we understand the difference between abstract data types and data structures, let's talk through what makes the stack abstract data type unique and also touch on the basic functionality we need a stack to have. Here's a high level definition of a stack. It holds a collection of items and the order in which they were added, and you can only add items to and remove items from the top of a stack. If you think of a stack as a stack of pancakes, you can only add to the top of the pancake stack and remove from the top of the pancake stack. We say this is last-in first-out because the most recent item you add is the one that's going to get removed next.\n",
    "* Another way you may hear this phrased is LIFO. It follows from this example that the order in which pancakes were added to the stack is preserved. In other words, you can't take the bottom pancake without considerable effort and a potential mess. When it comes to implementing a stack, our first consideration is whether or not Python has a built-in data type that we could use behind the scenes. We need a mutable data type that holds an ordered collection of items. A list fits this requirement perfectly.\n",
    "* So that's great. Python has a built-in data type we can use behind the scenes. The basic functionality for a stack is getting items into and out of the list we use to represent that linear data structure. When we code our stack class, we're going to use the right side of a list to represent the top of a stack. You can also think about this location as the end of the list. The reason we choose the end of the list has to do with run time.\n",
    "* Removing the last item of a list is done in constant time. So is appending an item to the end of the list. We may also want to know whether or not a stack is empty, how many items are in it, or which item is at the top. We'll create a method for each of those capabilities later on. We talked about some operations we'll need to be able to make on a stack. In terms of the data the stack will hold, it can be any data type that can be stored in a list. Further, the stack is what's called a limited access data structure.\n",
    "* This is because we can only access data from one place, the end of the list. A couple examples in which stacks could be used in your everyday life are a linter in your text editor which is able to tell you if you're missing an opening or closing symbol, or reversing the characters in a string which is a common interview question. A final note about stacks is that they have a unique property about them. And that is that they are also recursive data structures. A stack is either empty or it consists of a top item and the rest of which is a stack.\n",
    "* We won't discuss recursion in this course but knowing that a stack is a recursive data structure may come in handy in an interview."

    "* Now that we've discussed the stack abstract data type, we know what we want the stack to do, and we can start to stub out a stack class and its methods. First, we need to define the class itself. So let's call it Stack. We talked about how we need to use a Python list behind the scenes to represent the stack. So we can create an init method to do that. And we'll create a variable called self.items, and initialize that to our empty list.\n",
    "* The other basic functionality we need is we need to be able to add an item to the stack. The word we use for that is push. And we'll also need to pass into push the item that we want to add to the stack. Since we're just stemming things out now, we'll use the pass keyword to remind ourselves to come back to that later. Just like we added, we also need to be able to remove an item from the stack and we use the word pop for that. Now, because the list's built in pop method always returns the last item of the list anyway, we don't need to specify an index or an item that we want to remove.\n",
    "* That will take care of that automatically for us. Building on top of these two basic things, there are three other things we probably want to be able to do. The first is we'll want to peek perhaps at what the next item is that's going to be removed. We may want to know how many items are in the stack, and the word we use for that is size. And lastly, we may want to know whether or not the stack is empty.\n",
    "* So, we have stubbed out all of the methods for our stack class, and we'll start filling them in."

So we'll just say self dot items dot append and we'll pass in the item that we want to add. Now since this is a learning exercise, I do think it's a good idea that we add doc strings to each of these methods.\n",
    "* So I'm just going to write a brief note about what this method does. So I'll say, it accepts an item as a parameter, and appends it to the end of our list. And it returns nothing. Now we talked earlier about how appending to the end of a list happens in constant time. So let's make a note about the run time as well and the reason I think it's important to do this is data structures are often covered in interviews and typically, your interviewer will ask you about the run time.\n",
    "* So I'm just going to say that the run time for this method **is 0(1), or constant time**, because appending to the end of a list happens in constant time. And the reason this is constant time is what's actually happening is python is going directly to the last item of the list. It's indexing to the last item and indexing into a list. As you may know, happens in constant time.\n",

I'm using python3 and the way that I can run that is like this. And so, now all of the code that I just wrote is available in my terminal. So I can create my own stack object and, at this point the only method that we have is the push method.\n",
    "* So I can try that out by passing in apple, a string containing the word apple. Now remember that the variable that we're using here is items. So I can go back to the terminal, type in my stack dot items, and that will show me now what is in my list. If we add another item, let's say, banana. So we'll do my stack dot push and we'll pass in a string containing the word banana.\n",
    "* I expect that banana will appear to the right of apple. Let's see if that's correct. It is, and the reason this is the case is because we always consider the right side of the list to be the top of the stack and we can only add to and remove from the top so every time we add something else it's always going to show up on the right most side of that list.\n",

So, what I want to say is, as long as there are items in the list, give me the last item. To do that Pythonically, I can say, if self.items, and this basically means if there is something in self.items, return the popped value.\n",

I'll do python3 -i and then the name of my file. Okay, so, we'll recreate our stack object. And now, let's try calling that Pop Method again. Cool, this worked. It basically returned none.

And now, when I call my_stack.pop, what I should be getting is banana, because remember in our code we said, not only remove that last value, but return it, as well.

    "* Since we're representing our stack with a list, in order to figure out how many items are in the stack, all we need to do is use the list's built-in length method to find the length of the underlying list. So, we'll come into our size method here and really all I need to do is just return the result of calling that length method. So, we'll do, basically, find the length of self.items. I'll save this, and then go back to my terminal and run the file, interactively, of course. And here, I am going to create my own stack object and before I add anything to it, I want to check my size method, make sure I've coded it properly.\n",

Okay, and if I call the size method again, I expect that it would return one. And that's what I get. So, let's go back to the code here and we'll add our doc string and runtime note, as we have been.\n",

So, we'll say, in summary, this method runs in constant time because finding the length of a list also happens in constant time."
