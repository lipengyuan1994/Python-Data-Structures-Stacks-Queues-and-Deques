    "* In this challenge, your prompt is to create a function that takes in a string of symbol pairs as a parameter. \n",
    "* The function should return true if the symbol string is balanced or false if it isn't. Here's what we mean by a symbol string. The string should only contain opening and closing symbols like open and closed parenthesis, open and close square brackets, or open and close curly braces.\n",
    "* This is to mimic what happens in your text editor when the linter is checking for whether or not you remembered to close all of your opening symbols. In order for symbols to be balanced, each opening symbol should also have a closing symbol. And the symbols must be properly nested. You should, of course, make use of a stack in your solution. Here are some examples of what I mean by balanced symbols. And here are examples of unbalanced symbols. It's pretty obvious.\n",
    "* This is the same as the Leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/"
