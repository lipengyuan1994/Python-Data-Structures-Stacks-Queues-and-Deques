This is my personal learning repo of MITx 6.00.2x, it contains my learning note and some of the lecture PDFs. 

Learning Python from academic university is harder than you learn it from other boot-camps (like: datacamp....), especially when you want to learn it from MIT.
And, no need to say, you'll definitely learn something special from this course. For example, I have never learnt how to design **simulations** with Python code until I completed this course, although I've completed hundreds MOOCs previously.

I public this repo, but don't just copy and paste my code, please think about my solution, and please, if you find any issue or you have better solution, just send me a pull request. Let's make this repo better together. 



There's an old Chinese saying:  书山有路勤为径，学海无涯苦作舟。 

Happy learning!
